# 1. Sequenced data: list, tuple

# list: A list is an ordered collection of data with elements separated by a comma and enclosed within square brackets. Lists are mutable and can be modified after creation.

# list1 = [8, 2.3, [-4, 5], ['apple', 'banana']]
# print(list1)


# Tuple: A tuple is an ordered collection of data with elements separated by a comma and enclosed within parentheses. Tuples are immutable(Not changable) and can not be modified after creation.

# tuple1 = (("parrot", "sparrow"), ("Lion", "Tiger"))
# print(tuple1)




# 2. Mapped data: dict

# dict: A dictionary is an unordered collection of data containing a key:value pair. The key:value pairs are enclosed within curly brackets.

# dict1 = {"name":"Sakshi", "age":20, "canVote":True}
# print(dict1)
